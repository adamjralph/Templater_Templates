# Christian's Templater Templates
Found a template your like? Make sure you copy the raw file - not what Github renders. Click this button to see the raw file:

## Scripts
You will have to define a folder for your userscripts in Templater. Do this in your Templater settings under "Script files folder location". Remember, the scripts are called like this: `tp.user.QuickAdd(tp, choices);`, where `QuickAdd` is the _case-sensitive_ name of thie file. So, if you change the file name, change it in the markdown template as well.

#### Installation of Scripts
1. Grab both the `.md` and `.js` file. Make sure it is the _raw_ markdown file.
2. Make sure you've set a file path to "Script files folder location" as well as a "Template folder location" in your Templater settings.
3. Add the `.md` file ot the folder you've set as your "Template folder location".
4. Add the `.js` file ot the folder you've set as your "Script files folder location".

**IMPORTANT:** If you are inserting a template that has more than text (templater commands, etc), then you need to enable `Trigger Templater on file creation`.

### [QuickAdd v2](https://github.com/chhoumann/Templater_Templates/tree/master/quickadd)
Please use the [QuickAdd plugin](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) instead.

### https://github.com/chhoumann/Templater_Templates/tree/master/readwise
Insert anything from your Readwise account. You will need your Readwise token - which you can get [here](https://readwise.io/access_token).
It should be able to fetch anything from any time.

To get the main menu, use the `readwise.md` template. If you want to have a quote fetched from your "supplementals", you can use `readwisedaily.md`. I use that one in my daily note to show me a quote from one of the books I've marked as "supplemental".
